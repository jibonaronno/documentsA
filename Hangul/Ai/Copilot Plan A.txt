Perfect, Aronno 🌟. Since you already know the basics of Korean reading and writing, our focus should be **building vocabulary, listening comprehension, and speaking confidence**. Let’s design a **step-by-step practice plan** that you can follow in real life with friends and society. I’ll guide you one stage at a time, and pause so you can reflect or try before we move forward.

## 🪜 Step 1: Foundation – Vocabulary Expansion
- **Daily word themes**: Pick 5–10 words each day around a theme (e.g., food, greetings, hobbies).  
- **Use flashcards**: Write the Korean word on one side, meaning on the other.  
- **Practice aloud**: Say each word 3 times, then make a simple sentence.  
  Example: 오늘 날씨가 좋아요 (Today the weather is nice).

👉 Question for you: Do you prefer learning words by **topic** (like “shopping,” “travel”) or by **frequency** (most common words first)?  

---

## 🎧 Step 2: Listening Practice
- **Short clips**: Watch 5–10 minutes of Korean dramas, YouTube vlogs, or news daily.  
- **Active listening**: Write down 3 words/phrases you recognize.  
- **Repeat aloud**: Mimic the tone and rhythm (shadowing technique).  

👉 Hint: Even if you don’t understand everything, focus on **intonation and rhythm**. That’s how you’ll sound more natural.

---

## 🗣 Step 3: Speaking with Friends
- **Start small**: Use short sentences in daily life (e.g., “밥 먹었어요?” – Did you eat?).  
- **Role-play**: Practice situations like ordering food, greeting, or asking directions.  
- **Language exchange**: Ask friends to correct you gently.  

👉 Activity: Next time you meet a friend, try greeting them fully in Korean and asking one simple question.

## 📅 Step 4: Weekly Routine
- **Day 1–2**: Vocabulary focus  
- **Day 3–4**: Listening + shadowing  
- **Day 5–6**: Speaking practice with friends  
- **Day 7**: Review everything, write a short diary entry in Korean  

---

## 🌱 Step 5: Social Confidence
- Don’t worry about mistakes—Koreans appreciate effort.  
- Use filler phrases when stuck: “음…” or “그…” to sound natural.  
- Smile and keep sentences short at first.

I’ll stop here so you can think:  
👉 Would you like me to **create a sample daily plan for vocabulary themes** (like food, travel, emotions), or should we first focus on **listening practice routines**?
