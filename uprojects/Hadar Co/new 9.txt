After powering on, first send 0X08 to the 0X30 register, wait for 5ms, read two registers 0x09 and 0xA0, 
then send 0X09 to the 0X30 register, wait for 100ms, and then read the calibrated register data of 0X06, 0X07, and 0X08 to 
form a 24 bit pressure AD value, with the highest bit being the sign bit. When the sign bit value 
is "1", it represents "negative", and when the sign bit value is "0", it represents "positive".
