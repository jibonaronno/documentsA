Following error comes when trying to install apk to simulator.
signatures do not match the previously installed version

adb uninstall "com.yourapp.yourapp"
for us
adb uninstall "com.tebunia.tica"
also uninstall previous app from simulator.

Message is correct, windows is not supported. You can still use eas build --local on windows inside WSL or run npx expo 
prebuild and bulid from android studio.

Note that WSL technically it's not officially supported(we do not test it), but it seems to work well.

WSL installation instructions below. not recommandate now, but after these steps the default distro started working.

wsl --install Ubuntu // it will install and run a custom Ubuntu 22.0.4 as wsl.

to start we may need wsl ~ 
or
wsl --Ubuntu <Distribution Name> --user jibon
