On Raspberry side turn it in USB gadget mode following next steps:

1) Edit /boot/cmdline.txt
Add " modules-load=dwc2,g_ether" at the of the line (usually after "rootwait")

2) Edit /boot/config.txt
Go to the bottom and add a new line "dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=peripheral" at the end of file.

3) Edit /etc/modules
Enable extra modules by adding two lines at the end of file:
dwc2
g_ether

4) Create /etc/network/interfaces.d/usb0 with the next content:
allow-hotplug usb0
iface usb0 inet static
	address 10.10.10.10
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	gateway 10.10.10.1


On Raspberry side that's it, now you can reboot and plugin USB cable.




On Windows side install RNDIS driber (if it's necessary) and set up IP address on a new connection:

1) Plugin USB cable between Raspberrt and Windows, then check the "Device Manager". If it has a new network adapter, skip step (2).
If it's showing as a USB serial port instead, it needs to install RNDIS driver.

2) Install RNDIS drive if necessary
Right click on "USB Serial Device (COMx)" and select "Properties", then under the "Driver" find the "Update Driver" and click on it.
Then press "Browse my computers" button and direct it to a folder with saved driver files.

3) Setup static IP address
Open up "Network and Internet / Network Connections" in Control Panel, and click on a new RNDIS network.
Click on Adapter Settings and choose "Networking / Internet Protocol Version 4 Properties"
Click "Properties", select "Use the following IP address"
and enter 10.10.10.1 as the "IP address", and 255.255.255.0 as the "Subnet mask".


Unplug and replug in a Raspberry Pi, Windows will then identify the network.
